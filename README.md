# Knolwdge Officer [Product Mangment Track]: Product Management Fundamentals -> _Product Metrics & KPIs_**

You are a product manager at Facebook. They are launching a new feature that aims at adding the option of screen-sharing during voice and video calls where users can engage more with each other. You’re responsible for this feature and mainly reporting results about its launching.

As the product manager, what will be the metrics that you will measure your success by? How will you manage to arrange your metrics and preview them? What are the KPIs that indicate your efforts and results?

The business owner and the stakeholders are expecting a file defining your metrics and KPIs that you will choose to work with.

## Guidelines:
  - Choose the file type that you prefer and think can help you format and deliver your metrics and KPIs.
  - Your report should cover the following points:
     - The new feature’s general vision
     - The new feature’s metrics you choose and why 
     - The new feature's KPIs you will track
